# CLI Side

## Abstract

RedwoodJS supports many different "sides", or parts of an application.
Part of this structure is that it's easy to add, remove, and modify sides to meet the needs of an application.

This document will explore adding a CLI-side to an application. The added side will act as a client, accessing the application's through its API.
